Hi I'm Ismail Hatim currently a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at CentraleSup√©lec, I'm actively seeking a research-oriented internship in AI to conclude my studies. 

My current focus is on a project related to fairness in graph neural networks, a topic that fascinates me for its potential to make AI more equitable and impactful. Driven by a passion for research. 

I am also looking to pursue a PhD next year, with the goal of deepening my expertise and contributing to cutting-edge advancements in AI.
