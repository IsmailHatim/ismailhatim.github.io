Hi, I'm Ismail Hatim, a MSc student in Artificial Intelligence at CentraleSup√©lec, with a strong passion for advancing the frontiers of AI research. My academic and professional journey has encompassed diverse areas of machine learning and deep learning, with a research project focused on fairness in graph neural networks.

Beyond GNNs, I have cultivated a deep interest in reinforcement learning, machine learning optimization techniques, and the theoretical underpinnings of deep learning architectures. I will soon undertake an internship focused on uncertainty in vision-language models (VLMs), exploring ways to enhance the reliability of AI systems. 

Finally, I aim to pursue a PhD exploring broader areas, including machine learning, deep learning, graph neural networks, and reinforcement learning, to contribute to cutting-edge advancements in AI.
