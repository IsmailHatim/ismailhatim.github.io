Hi, I’m Ismail Hatim, a PhD student at the **École Polytechnique**, within the CEDAR **Inria** team at the LIX laboratory, supervised by [Prof. Yanlei Diao](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~yanlei.diao/), [Dr. Benoît Gallix](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beno%C3%AEt-gallix-386baa6b/) (**American Hospital of Paris**), and [Dr. Guillaume Lachaud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaume-lachaud-39099511b/). 

My research focuses on *GTNmed*, a graph transformer–based foundation model for sparse, heterogeneous, and multimodal electronic health records (EHR), at the intersection of graph machine learning, healthcare AI, and data systems.


Before starting my PhD, I completed an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at **CentraleSupélec**, where I worked on fairness in graph generative models and multimodal imputation for clinical data. 

More broadly, I am interested in graph representation learning, foundation models, reinforcement learning, and the optimization and theoretical principles underlying modern deep learning systems.
