Hi, I’m Ismail Hatim, a research engineer at the LIX laboratory (École Polytechnique, Institut Polytechnique de Paris), preparing a PhD under the supervision of Prof. Yanlei Diao starting in January 2026. 
I recently completed an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at CentraleSupélec, where I worked on fairness in graph generative models and multimodal imputation for electronic health records.
My current research focuses on GTNmed, a graph transformer–based foundation model for sparse and heterogeneous medical EHR data, at the intersection of graph machine learning, healthcare AI, and data systems. 
More broadly, I am interested in graph neural networks, foundation models, reinforcement learning, and the optimization and theory underlying modern deep learning architectures.
