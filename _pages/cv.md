Education
======
* MSc in Artificial Intelligence at CentraleSupélec, Gif-sur-Yvette France, 2025 (expected)
* Engineering M.S specialized in Computer Science and SYstems at ENSEA, Cergy France, 2023
* Preparatory class for the Grande Écoles at Lycée Chaptal - Maths Physics star class, 2019

Academic projects
======
* CentraleSupélec - Lab Project : Fairness in Generative Graph Machine Learning 
  * Designed and implemented an evaluation pipeline of fairness in GeML models, focusing on architectures like VGAE and diffusion models.
  * Utilized PyTorch Geometric to manage graph data structures and build GNN architectures for tasks such as node classification.
  * Collaborated with CVN and Inria OPIS, with guidance from researchers to align the project in AI ethics and fairness.
* CentraleSupélec - Research Project: Explainability in AI Models Gif-sur-Yvette, France
  * Designed a framework aiming to enhance interpretability in image classification by decomposing model decisions into spatial attributions.
  * Applied the method on various vision models (e.g., ResNet, DenseNet) and validated its robustness under common explainability methods.
* CentraleSupélec - AI Challenge
  * Developed a heuristic AI for a board game implementing algorithms like Alpha-Beta pruning, with potential for more complex strategies.
* ENSEA - Cross-disciplinary software project 
  * Creation of a clone of the "Terraforming Mars" board game in C++, featuring basic, heuristic, and advanced AI strategies
